# DueDay: Your School life, organized

Most students struggle keeping track of all their assignments, class venues and timings and events that may come up over the course of their time at school due to the hassle of looking through group chats filled with different topics or the delay that comes with relying on their colleague’s reply times. That’s where DueDay comes in.

DueDay is an all-in-one student productivity and academic planning web platform that helps students stay on top of their assignments, class schedules and events around school with the goal of making school life easier for students to deal with.

DueDay’s features include: A timetable that allows students to check their class timings and venues, an assignment tracker that allows students to stay on track of all the assignments they’re given, reminders for upcoming classes and assignment due dates, an announcements panel where module leaders can share important updates with the students, an assignment feedback system that allows students to make comments on specific assignments, a school events calendar where students can view all the scheduled events in school, a weekly dashboard where students can get a visual overview of classes, due dates and events among other additional features like voting polls and leaderboards.

DueDay can be implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the frontend, PHP on the backend and MySQL as our database.

In addition, security features such as: Encrypted passwords and HTTPS, role based user access, input validation and SQL injection protection will be implemented into DueDay.

Problems that may arise in the course of development may include: Complex database relationships, email delivery reliability, role management, data security and User engagement. We aim to deal with these by using foreign keys and normalization, using PHPMailer with SMTP instead of mail(), Implementing access control layers in PHP, encrypting data and hashing passwords, and integrating gamified features like leaderboards and interactive dashboards.

Looking forward to go through this DueDay journey with you.
